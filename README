Uses rsnapshot with crypted disks.

In crontab:
0 */8 * * *     root    /etc/rsnapshot-wrapper.sh hourly
50 3 * * *      root    /etc/rsnapshot-wrapper.sh daily
40 2 * * 6      root    /etc/rsnapshot-wrapper.sh weekly
30 1 1 * *      root    /etc/rsnapshot-wrapper.sh monthly

Some modifications needed for backup-common.sh, mainly adding correct paths and volume name for crypted backup volume.
